Apprentices in this program are trained for months by expert instructors who have a lot of knowledge in the field of tourism and lead their students to become the future ambassadors of the many natural and cultural attractions found all over the country. In this occasion some apprentices from the Tourist Guide Program in Valle had a great experience last month while taking some visitors from The United States of America on a tour in Cali and to some other municipalities in Valle del Cauca. \\nWhen the tourists arrived ___(23)___ Cali, the apprentices guided them around the city and showed them some interesting places. They started by taking them to a walk around the Historic Center of Cali, where many interesting touristic sites are concentrated, like monuments, buildings, squares, main streets, and others that tell a lot about the history of the city as well as the country’s. After that, they visited La Ermita Church which drew the attention of the tourists with ___(24)___ Gothic style. Then they went to The Caicedo Square, considered to be the first square built in the city, which is very close to their next visit, The San Pedro Cathedral, a temple where Catholics meet to ___(25)___ and it represents an important spot for the city. \\nAlong this route, the tourists were also ___(26)___ to The San Francisco Church and The Municipal Theater, among others. The tour ended in The San Antonio Church where they enjoyed a wonderful view of the city and ate a delicious and sweet oblea, which is a type of wafer sandwich with melted caramel, common to several regions of the country. \\nThe next day, they visited the western part of the city, starting at El Gato del Río, a sculpture made ___(27)___ the Colombian artist Hernando Tejada. After that, they headed to The Centenario Library and El Obelisco Restaurant, where they ate some of our traditional empanadas, an unknown and delicious dish for foreign visitors, and when asking about this culinary experience to the group, one of the tourists immediately exclaimed how ___(28)___ they were.  Afterwards, they visited La Tertulia Museum and then went to the Zoo, believed to be one of the best zoos in the country and where the group met a diverse variety of animals, learned about them, took photos, and especially, had the pleasure of ___(29)___ a place dedicated to nature. \\nAfter a few days in the city taking different routes, both tourists and apprentices went to other municipalities from the department, like Ginebra, a municipality in Cauca where they ate the best chicken soup from the region and learned about Andean music. \\nWhen evaluating the activity, the apprentice in charge commented that it had been such a great experience, where they had the opportunity of practicing and using the skills they ___(30)___ in their training process at SENA and that now they feel they are prepared to have more practices like the one they just had and to do their best when working for travel companies or their own businesses.","pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":258}},"html5data":{"xPos":-1,"yPos":-1,"width":707,"height":399,"strokewidth":0}},"width":706,"height":398,"resume":false,"useHandCursor":true,"id":"6mWmEgpTeeo"},{"kind":"vectorshape","rotation":0,"accType":"text","cliptobounds":false,"defaultAction":"","textLib":[{"kind":"textdata","uniqueId":"6agrfBcQKA3_660631436","id":"01","linkId":"txt__default_6agrfBcQKA3","type":"vectortext","xPos":0,"yPos":0,"width":0,"height":0,"shadowIndex":-1,"vectortext":{"left":0,"top":0,"right":146,"bottom":25,"pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":260}}}],"shapemaskId":"","xPos":2,"yPos":1,"tabIndex":1,"tabEnabled":true,"xOffset":0,"yOffset":0,"rotateXPos":78.5,"rotateYPos":13.5,"scaleX":100,"scaleY":100,"alpha":100,"depth":5,"scrolling":true,"shuffleLock":false,"data":{"hotlinkId":"","accState":0,"vectorData":{"left":0,"top":0,"right":157,"bottom":27,"altText":"Questions 21 - 30","pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":160}},"html5data":{"xPos":-1,"yPos":-1,"width":158,"height":28,"strokewidth":0}},"width":157,"height":27,"resume":false,"useHandCursor":true,"id":"6agrfBcQKA3"},{"kind":"vectorshape","rotation":0,"accType":"text","cliptobounds":false,"defaultAction":"","textLib":[{"kind":"textdata","uniqueId":"6PWpWgn8mLt_-1083907840","id":"01","linkId":"txt__default_6PWpWgn8mLt","type":"vectortext","xPos":0,"yPos":0,"width":0,"height":0,"shadowIndex":-1,"vectortext":{"left":0,"top":0,"right":309,"bottom":22,"pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":262}}}],"shapemaskId":"","xPos":140,"yPos":-1,"tabIndex":0,"tabEnabled":true,"xOffset":0,"yOffset":0,"rotateXPos":162,"rotateYPos":14.5,"scaleX":100,"scaleY":100,"alpha":100,"depth":6,"scrolling":true,"shuffleLock":false,"data":{"hotlinkId":"","accState":0,"vectorData":{"left":0,"top":0,"right":325,"bottom":29,"altText":"Read the text below and choose the correct word for each space on the following pages.","pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":261}},"html5data":{"xPos":-1,"yPos":-1,"width":326,"height":30,"strokewidth":0}},"width":324,"height":29,"resume":false,"useHandCursor":true,"id":"6PWpWgn8mLt"}],"startTime":-1,"elapsedTimeMode":"normal","useHandCursor":false,"resume":false,"kind":"slidelayer","isBaseLayer":true}]}');
